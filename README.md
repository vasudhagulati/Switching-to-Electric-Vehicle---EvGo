# Switching-to-Electric-Vehicle---EvGo
•	EVgo is an electric vehicle purchasing decision support system created to support potential buyers in the decision-making process for the acquisition of an electric vehicle.
•	Model utilizes user inputs to create top customized options and provides car specifications of interest to potential EV owners such as recommended brand, running costs, yearly mileage, acceleration/sec, top speed, range, etc.
•	For sourcing the model, I used an “Electric Car Dataset” from Kaggle.
•	Created a VBA user form to capture user inputs.
•	Created a subroutine that highlights any rows in the Electric Car Dataset that match the user inputs.
